Hi! My name is Marcus and for a long time I've wanted to become a data analyst! This quaratine I had an opportunity to focus on it to be able to change my life completely! 
I have alwyas been that person that if I didn't know how to do something, I'd figure it out through logic and structural thinking kind of like in data analysis.
