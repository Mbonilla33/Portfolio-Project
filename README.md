# Portfolio-Project
Hi! My name is Marcus and for a long time I've wanted to become a data analyst! This quaratine I had an opportunity to focus on it to be able to change my life completely! 
I have alwyas been that person that if I didn't know how to do something, I'd figure it out through logic and structural thinking kind of like in data analysis. 
This repository is mainly for projects I have done to highlight my skills to becoming an excellent analyst someday. Online programs have prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.
